# C version of NEWUOA

This provides a C implementation of Mike Powell's NEWUOA algorithm for
minimizing a function of many variables.  The method is *derivatives free*
(only the function values are needed) and accounts for bound constraints on
the variables.  The algorithm is described in:

> M.J.D. Powell, "The NEWUOA software for unconstrained minimization
> without derivatives", in Large-Scale Nonlinear Optimization, editors
> G. Di Pillo and M. Roma, Springer (2006), pages 255-297.

NEWUOA builds a quadratic model of the objective function from much less
than `(N+1)(N+2)/2` values of the function (with `N` the number of
variables).  The recommended number of points for building the quadratic
model is `2*N+1`.  For smooth objective functions, NEWUOA is expected to be
more efficient than COBYLA (which exploits a more simple linear model but
implements arbitrary inequality constraints while NEWUOA is unconstrained).
If you have bound constraints, you may consider using BOBYQA instead.

In addition to being usable from C code, this version of NEWUOA has a few
improvements over the FORTRAN version:

* any objective function can be used (the function is an argument of the
  method) so different objective functions can co-exist in the same code
  (*e.g.* hierarchical optimization with NEWUOA is possible);

* a return code indicates the success of the method or the reason of the
  failure;

* reverse communication version of the algorithm is also provided, this
  version is exploited by the Yorick plgin in directory
  [`yorick`](./yorick);

* no warnings about variables being uninitialized.

Of course, this version produces the same output for the tests and it has a
more C-like interface compared to a version produced by `f2c`.  A FORTRAN
wrapper is available.


## Usage

The code consists in two files [`newuoa.c`](./newuoa.c) and [`newuoa.h`](./newuoa.h)
and is documented in the header [`newuoa.h`](./newuoa.h).

To build the library, edit the `Makefile` to suit your preferences and
do:
```
make
```
Then copy `libnewuoa.a` and `newuoa.h` to appropriate directories.

A number of macros can defined for the compiler to adapt the type of variables
used in the code (see [`newuoa.h`](./newuoa.h) for details).

You may check the code (this requires the original FORTRAN code available
from Mike Powell on request at mjdp@cam.ac.uk):
```
make test
```
