     The function `newuoa_create` makes a new instance for Mike Powell's NEWUOA
     algorithm for minimizing a function of many variables.  The method is
     "derivatives free" (only the function values are needed).

     N is the number of variables, NPT is the number of interpolation
     conditions. Its value must be in the interval [N+2,(N+1)(N+2)/2].  The
     ecommended number of points for building the quadratic model is NPT=2*N+1.

     RHOBEG and RHOEND are the initial and final values of a trust region
     radius, so both must be positive with RHOEND <= RHOBEG.  Typically RHOBEG
     should be about one tenth of the greatest expected change to a variable,
     and RHOEND should indicate the accuracy that is required in the final
     values of the variables.

     The value of IPRINT should be set to 0, 1, 2 or 3, which controls the
     amount of printing. Specifically, there is no output if IPRINT=0 and there
     is output only at the return if IPRINT=1. Otherwise, each new value of RHO
     is printed, with the best vector of variables so far and the corresponding
     value of the objective function.  Further, each new value of F with its
     variables are output if IPRINT=3.

     MAXFUN must be set to an upper bound on the number of objective function
     calls.

     The function `newuoa_iterate` performs an iteration of the algorithm given
     F the function value at the current variables X.

     Typical usage is:

     >   ctx = newuoa_create(n, npt, rhobeg, rhoend, iprint, maxfun);
     >   x = ...; // initial solution
     >   while (ctx.status == NEWUOA_ITERATE) {
     >     f = ...; // compute function value at X
     >     newuoa_iterate, ctx, f, x;
     >   }
     >   if (ctx.status != NEWUOA_SUCCESS) {
     >     error, swrite(format="Something wrong occured in NEWUOA: %s",
     >                   ctx.reason);
     >   }

     The context object CTX returned by the function `newuoa_create` has the
     following members:

         ctx.n       number of variables
         ctx.npt     number of intepolation points
         ctx.rho     radius of the trust region
         ctx.status  current status
         ctx.nevals  number of function evaluations so far
         ctx.reason  textual description of current status
